    "- There has been a revenue decline for the Portuguese bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, we found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have a higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing effort on such clients. \n",

    "3. **Loan Attribute:** the people who do not have any financial obligations like loans tend more to subscribe on a term deposit.\n",
